# Fraudsters_Model

The Fraudsters Model is made in Python, but is put into production in a R-Shiny App and make Batch predictions from Raw Data and export a CSV with the prediction for each customer.

1. The model has better Fraudsters-Precision, so we have more certainty identifying Fraudsters, but lower Fraudsters-Recall, then some Fraudsters go unnoticed.

2. The model has better Good Users-Recall, so we have more certainty identifying all Good Users, but lower Good Users-Precision, then some Fraudsters go unnoticed.
